# Backlog

Deferred work, recorded so it isn't re-litigated from scratch. Items leave
this list by becoming a PR.

- **`/admin` subscriber dashboard.** For now the Supabase table view of
  `subscribers` is the dashboard (counts, statuses, manual fixes). A proper
  authenticated `/admin` page — subscriber counts over time, confirm rate,
  manual unsubscribe — is deliberately deferred until the list is big enough
  to need it.
- **Submissions intake** (Part 2 of the backend plan): `submissions` table,
  `/submit` page, receipt confirmation email. Separate PR after the
  subscriptions PR merges.
- **Agent-direct submission API** (Part 3): design proposal first, then its
  own PR (see the Charter's agent-direct track).
- **DMARC tightening:** after two clean weeks of aggregate reports, move
  `_dmarc.mail` from `p=none` to `p=quarantine` (see docs/EMAIL.md).
